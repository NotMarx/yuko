# Yuko Major Update

I've not been working on fixing bugs or adding new features just yet for the reason that I'm rewriting the whole library into TypeScript instead JavaScript.

## What Are The Changes??

I'm not working on designing the library as percise and per in the Discord API docs instead, I'm working on following my own library design. Don't worry I'm not going to be crazy
on adding useless features and making things harder ðŸ˜…

The full and detail changes will be shared after the development for version **0.2** finished (for technical reason, we need to skip **0.1**).

**Thanks for Reading!**
